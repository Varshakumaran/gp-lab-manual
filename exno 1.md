# EXP-01: Implementing various effects in a material such as emissive, roughness and metallic properties in Unreal Engine.
## Date: 5-03-2025
## Aim:
To implement various effects in a material such as emissive, roughness and metallic
properties in Unreal Engine.

## Procedure:
1.Input values (textures/constants) for each property.
2.Unreal Engine maps these to visual changes.
Emissive: Value = glow intensity.
Roughness: Value = matte (high) to shiny (low).
Metallic: Value = metal-like (high) or not (low) reflections.
3.Object renders with these effects.

## Output:
